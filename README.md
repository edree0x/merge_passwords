# merge_passwords
This script allows merged password files exported from platforms like LastPass and Samsung Pass into one CSV file.


Description: The code approved CSV files exported from password platforms (such as LastPASS and Samsung Pass). Collect columns from all files in one file. You can use the code with files with the same format or with a slight difference in the columns.

How to use in Python:

Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
Fill the script from the command line.
Example: python mege_passwords.py merged.csv last
How to use in C ++:

Make sure you have a C ++ translator.
Collect the code (example with G ++): G ++ mege_passwords.cPP -o mege_passwords
Fill the program:.
Note:

Ensure that the files you want to combine in CSV format.
If the heads of the columns differ between the files, the python collects the fields with filling the void when there is no data.
You can modify the code as you need.
